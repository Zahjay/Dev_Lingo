# Dev Lingo Proposal | Zahra Abd'Allah
Dev Lingo is a small, yet fun solution to the common phrases that has been reiterated daily since I've started GA those sayings are as follows: "look it up", " documentation is you friend", etc. 

I have always heard that knowing the lingo of what you're doing can make your life easier, that being said this game is designed to make life easier in a fun way. My game will give you the developer terms of the profession, and you will have to answer them. Duh Duh Duh.... this is your moment of true good luck!

# Wireframe
Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more . I did a wireframe of what I want the game to look like. I drew it out. 

# Intial Thoughts
 Write out what challenges you expect to encounter, or ideas you want to come up with.
Expected Challenges
I am worried to be honest. I'm trying to tackle my weakness of conditional logic, arrays, for loops, etc. with this game. 
 Ideas to come up with
I want to create a game that will aid web developers of every level with the lingo of the profession. If you don't know the lingo of what you're dong you are automatically at a deficit, thus 
Dev Lingo was born. It's a soulution to a problem. hopefully I can create levels to this game in the future and broaden and divide the terms based on the language you want to study.
